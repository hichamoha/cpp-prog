  View::print(" In a land of myth, and time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name: Merlin. Merlin is a young wizard who arrives in the kingdom of Camelot after his mother arranges for him to stay with the court physician, Gaius. He discovers that the king, Uther Pendragon, has outlawed magic and imprisoned the last Dragon in a vast cavern deep under the kingdom. After hearing a mysterious voice inside his head, Merlin makes his way to the cavern beneath Camelot where the Dragon tells Merlin that he plays an important role: to protect Uther's son, Arthur, who will bring forth a great kingdom. The Great Dragon gives Merlin grudging advice and forges the sword of Excalibur in his breath for Arthur, but persistently demands his freedom in return. Merlin eventually does release him. As mortal weapons cannot kill Morgana, Excalibur is the only weapon that can slay her. As the prophecy states, she died by Merlin's hand. Merlin calls the Great Dragon to carry him and Arthur to Avalon.");
